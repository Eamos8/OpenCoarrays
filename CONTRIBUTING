Contribution procedure

This document describes several pieces of information required for
a contribution of code to OpenCoarrays to be approved.  A patch can be
structured in two parts: ChangeLog and actual patch.  The ChangeLog 
should contain a description of the problem/bug, how the patch fixes the
problem/bug, the date, the author name and email address, and the 
signed-off-by line as detailed below.

The patch can be automatically created using 

git show > patch.diff

after a local commit on the repository.

Once a patch is created, the ChangeLog can be written on
top of it in plain-text according to the following format:

/--------------------------------------------------------------------\

<yyyy-mm-dd> + two spaces + <First and Last Name> + two spaces + <email>

optionally followed by <tab> + 4 spaces + Name/email of the second/third/... contributor

Empty line.

And then:
<tab> + * <filename> (<section1>, <section2>): <what you did>.
<tab> + (<section3>): <what else you did>.
<tab> + * <filename2> (<section>): <ditto>.

Signed-off-by: <First and Last Name>  <email> (for each author)

/--------------------------------------------------------------------\

The last line certifies the DCO agreement (see below).


Patch submission

In order to submit a patch, a contributor should send the .diff file 
(complete with ChangeLog and source) to opencoarrays@googlegroups.com,
after which the patch will be reviewed.  Once a common agreement has 
been reached, the patch will be committed to the repository by one of 
the OpenCoarrays developers.

In order to contribute to the OpenCoarrays project, you must
certify compliance with the Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO),
quoted below.

If you are a company employee who contributes to OpenCoarrays on your 
employer's behalf, please request a required form via the aforementioned
mailing list.
