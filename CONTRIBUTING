Contribution procedure

Every contribution must contain several information in order to be
approved. 
A patch can be structured in two parts: ChangeLog and actual patch.
The ChangeLog should contain a description of the problem/bug and how
the patch fix it, date, author name and email and the signed-off-by line.
The patch can be automatically created using 

git show > patch.diff

after a local commit on the repository.

Once a patch is created, the ChangeLog can be written on
top of it in plain-text according to the following format:

/--------------------------------------------------------------------\

<yyyy-mm-dd> + two spaces + <First and Last Name> + two spaces + <email>

optionally followed by <tab> + 4 spaces + Name/email of the second/third/... contributor

Empty line.

And then:
<tab> + * <filename> (<section1>, <section2>): <what you did>.
<tab> + (<section3>): <what else you did>.
<tab> + * <filename2> (<section>): <ditto>.

Signed-off-by: <First and Last Name>  <email> (for each author)

/--------------------------------------------------------------------\

The last line certifies the DCO agreement (see below).


Patch submission

In order to submit a patch a contributor should send the .diff file 
(complete of ChangeLog and source) to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencoarrays.
At that point the patch will be reviewed.
Once reached a common agreement the patch will be committed on the repository by one
of the OpenCoarrays's developers.

In order to contribute to the OpenCoarray project, you have to
certify compliance to the Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO),
quoted below.

If you are a company employee which works on the library on its behalf,
you are required to send us a specific form which will be made available very
soon.
